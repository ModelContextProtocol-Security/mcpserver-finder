- `quality-indicators/` - Technical quality assessment criteria
- `best-practices/` - Proven approaches for server selection and usage

## Purpose

These resources support both the conversational prompts and eventual MCP server tools by providing structured, reusable knowledge that can be referenced during server evaluation and selection processes.
