# Research

This directory contains draft ideas, research notes, and exploratory work that feeds into the development of prompts, resources, and tools.

**Note:** All content in this directory is speculative and represents early-stage thinking. These documents are working drafts that will evolve significantly as we refine our understanding of user needs and technical requirements. Please consider them as starting points for discussion rather than final specifications.

## Structure

- `mcp-server-finder_capabilities.md` - High-level capability specification for the finder system
- `mcp-server-finder_evaluation_template.md` - Comprehensive evaluation template for server assessment
- `discovery-criteria/` - Research on effective server discovery methods (future)
- `quality-indicators/` - Research on what makes a good MCP server (future)
- `teaching-methods/` - Research on effective tutoring and educational approaches (future)
- `community-feedback/` - Analysis of user feedback and community needs (future)
- `server-analysis/` - Case studies of server discovery and selection processes (future)

## Purpose

This is the working space for developing and refining the expert knowledge that gets distilled into the prompts and resources directories. Content here is more experimental and may include incomplete ideas, rough drafts, and exploratory analysis.

## Process

Good ideas and proven concepts from research should be extracted and formalized into the appropriate prompts/ or resources/ directories.
