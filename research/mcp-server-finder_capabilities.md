# MCP Server Finder – High‑Level Capability Specification

> **Draft Document:** This specification represents early conceptual thinking and will undergo substantial revision based on user feedback and technical validation. The capabilities and approaches described here should be considered exploratory rather than definitive.

## 1 Primary Operating Modes
| Mode | Description | Typical Entry Point |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Targeted Evaluation** | The user nominates **one or more specific MCP servers** they already know about. The Finder performs a structured, criteria‑driven assessment. | "Evaluate *mcp‑server‑xyz* for me." |
| **Needs‑Driven Discovery** | The user describes a **workflow, requirement set, or pain‑point**. The Finder elicits additional context, maps needs to MCP capabilities, and surfaces viable server candidates (or flags gaps). | "I need on‑prem context management for local file‑system agents—what MCP servers can do that?" |

## 2 Core Functional Capabilities
1. **Requirements Analysis**  
   - Socratic questioning to clarify business goals, constraints, and success criteria.  
   - Accepts free‑form conversation, bulleted briefs, or uploaded workflow docs (future: parse BPMN / Markdown / JSON).

2. **Server Discovery & Short‑Listing**  
   - GitHub / registry searches, tag+keyword heuristics, reputation signals.  
   - Ability to filter by language, license, deployment model, maintainer region, etc.

3. **Contextual Evaluation Engine**  
   - **Green‑Flag / Red‑Flag generator** with *context sensitivity*.  
   - Scoring grid adaptable to user priorities (security weight ↑, cost weight ↓, etc.).  
   - Community & ecosystem health checks (commit velocity, contributor diversity, issue hygiene, language adoption).

4. **Comparative Analysis**  
   - Side‑by‑side matrix for multiple servers.  
   - Trade‑off narrative framed around user‑defined priorities.

5. **Guided Recommendation & Next‑Steps**  
   - Clear rationale + fallback options.  
   - Implementation, risk‑mitigation, and monitoring check‑lists.

6. **Learning & Tutoring Layer**  
   - Explains *why* each flag was raised and *how* to verify it manually.  
   - Stores session notes → optional report export (Markdown/CSV/JSON).

## 3 Green‑Flag / Red‑Flag Framework
| Category | Green Flags (Positive Indicators) | Red Flags (Caution / Risk) | Context‑Dependent Flags* |
|----------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Project Activity** | Frequent commits, active issue triage, >3 maintainers | No commits in 12 mo, unanswered issues | Single‑maintainer but funded by a reputable org |
| **Security Posture** | Documented threat model, CVE process, encrypted transport by default | Known CVEs unpatched, hard‑coded secrets | Region‑specific crypto controls |
| **License & Legal** | OSI‑approved license compatible with user's project | Ambiguous or custom restrictive license | GPL v3 may be fine for internal, problematic for closed‑source |
| **Community Health** | Vibrant discussions, external contributors, published road‑map | Toxic issue threads, spam PRs, no community channels | Small private Slack may be okay for some |
| **Ecosystem Fit** | Popular language/runtime, SDKs, integration plugins | Written in niche language with few devs available | Rust‑only might be green in Rust shops, red elsewhere |
| **Provenance & Hosting** | Transparency about maintainer identity, signed releases | Anonymous maintainer, no release checksums | Maintainer in embargoed country (export controls) |

\*Context‑dependent flags are not auto‑scored. The assistant surfaces them and prompts the user to state whether each is a positive or negative in their scenario.

## 4 Interaction Workflow (Simplified)
1. **Session Start**  
   `→` Detect whether the user supplied servers or a need statement.  
2. **Clarify Requirements**  
   `→` Ask targeted questions; build requirements profile.  
3. **Run Discovery / Fetch Metadata**  
   `→` Query sources, gather candidate list + raw metrics.  
4. **Generate Flags & Score**  
   `→` Apply Green/Red/Contextual assessments, weight by priorities.  
5. **Present Findings & Teach**  
   `→` Show comparison matrix, explain each flag, invite user judgment.  
6. **Recommend & Plan**  
   `→` Output decision rationale, next‑step checklist, and learning recap.

## 5 Extensibility Road‑Map (Post‑Prompt Phase)
- **Pluggable Scoring Plugins** (e.g., OWASP Dependency‑Check, SLSA verifier).  
- **Persona Variants** (assertive advisor, quick‑answer mode, compliance auditor).  
- **Structured Output API** (MCP‑compatible server delivering JSON reports).  
- **Continuous Knowledge Sync** (scheduled crawler to refresh repo metrics).
