# Repository Separation Plan

## The Problem: Mixed Responsibilities

During development of the MCP Server Finder, we inadvertently built a comprehensive **audit system** with finder capabilities mixed in, rather than a **finder system** with some evaluation capabilities.

### What We Actually Built

**Deep Security Assessment System:**
- Comprehensive security assessment workflows
- Detailed security checks with CWE mappings  
- Enterprise compliance integration (NIST, ISO 27001, SOC 2)
- Advanced vulnerability analysis capabilities
- Detailed threat modeling and risk quantification
- Security framework integration (MITRE ATT&CK, OWASP)
- Enterprise security intelligence features

### What "Finder" Should Actually Be

**Discovery and Selection System:**
- Discovery based on user needs and requirements
- High-level evaluation and comparison capabilities
- "Should I investigate this further?" decision support
- Community intelligence and reputation assessment
- Server selection guidance and recommendations
- Basic quality indicators and red flag detection

## Proposed Separation Strategy

### MCP Server Finder (this repo) - Keep:
- `needs-driven-discovery.md` - Core finder functionality for discovering servers based on requirements
- `targeted-evaluation.md` - High-level evaluation guidance for basic assessment
- `main-prompt.md` - General tutoring and guidance capabilities
- Basic quality and reputation assessment workflows
- Server comparison and selection decision support
- Community intelligence and server-db integration
- "Is this worth deeper security analysis?" guidance
- Discovery-focused prompts and resources

### MCP Server Audit (other repo) - Move there:
- `security-assessment.md` - Deep security evaluation and assessment workflows
- `/checks/` directory - All detailed security checks and procedures
- Security framework integration (CWE, NIST, OWASP, ISO 27001, compliance reporting)
- Advanced security analysis TODO items and roadmap
- Enterprise security intelligence features
- Detailed threat modeling and risk quantification capabilities
- Security-focused prompts and advanced assessment tools

### Integration Points - Both repos:
- **Finder recommends Audit** - When deep security assessment is needed
- **Audit references Finder** - For discovery and community intelligence context
- **Shared databases** - Both use server-db for server profiles and community data
- **Cross-references** - Clear links between discovery and detailed assessment workflows
- **Coordinated development** - Both tools work together as complementary systems

## Benefits of This Separation

### Clearer Value Propositions
- **Finder** = Discovery, comparison, and selection guidance
- **Audit** = Deep security assessment and compliance analysis
- **Users can choose** the right tool for their specific needs

### Better User Experience
- **Focused workflows** - Each tool optimized for its primary purpose
- **Reduced complexity** - Users aren't overwhelmed by features they don't need
- **Clear entry points** - Obvious starting point based on user goals

### Focused Development
- **Specialized expertise** - Each tool can excel at its core mission
- **Targeted improvements** - Development efforts aligned with tool purpose
- **Clearer roadmaps** - Feature development follows tool focus

### Modular Architecture
- **Independent usage** - Tools can be used separately or together
- **Flexible deployment** - Organizations can adopt one or both tools
- **Scalable maintenance** - Different teams can maintain different tools

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Content Preservation
1. Copy all current content from mcpserver-finder to mcpserver-audit
2. Ensure all documentation, prompts, checks, and resources are preserved
3. Maintain all cross-references and integration points

### Phase 2: Repository Cleanup
1. **Clean up Finder repo**: Remove audit-heavy content, focus on discovery and selection
2. **Clean up Audit repo**: Remove finder-specific content, focus on security assessment
3. **Update cross-references**: Ensure proper links between the separated tools

### Phase 3: Integration Refinement
1. Define clear handoff points between finder and audit workflows
2. Establish shared data formats and database schemas
3. Create seamless user experience across both tools

## Success Criteria

- **Clear separation of concerns** between discovery and security assessment
- **Maintained functionality** - All current capabilities preserved across both tools
- **Improved user experience** - Users can easily choose and use the right tool
- **Strong integration** - Tools work together seamlessly when needed
- **Focused development** - Each repository has a clear, specialized mission
