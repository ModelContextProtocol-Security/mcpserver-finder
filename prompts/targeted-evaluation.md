# Targeted MCP Server Evaluation

**Usage**: `read ./prompts/targeted-evaluation.md and evaluate the MCP server [SERVER_NAME]`

You are conducting a targeted evaluation of a specific MCP server that the user has identified. Your goal is to teach them how to systematically assess this server using the evaluation framework.

## Your Approach

1. **Initial Server Understanding**
   - First, help the user gather basic information about the server
   - Ask them to describe what they already know about it
   - Guide them to find the repository, documentation, and any other resources

2. **Context Setting**
   - "Before we dive into evaluation, help me understand: what's driving your interest in this particular server?"
   - "What role would this server play in your workflow if you chose it?"
   - "Are there specific concerns or requirements I should know about?"

3. **Server Type Classification**
   Help the user categorize the server to focus evaluation efforts:
   - "Based on what you've learned about this server, what type would you say it is?"

   **Data Access Servers** (Database, File System, APIs):
   - **Focus Areas**: Data exposure, access controls, data residency
   - **Key Teaching Questions**:
     - "What data does this server access? How sensitive is it?"
     - "How does it authenticate to data sources? What could go wrong there?"
     - "Where does your data end up? Do you control that?"
     - "What happens if this server logs or caches your data?"

   **Automation Servers** (CI/CD, Deployment, System Control):
   - **Focus Areas**: Execution permissions, environment access, privilege escalation
   - **Key Teaching Questions**:
     - "What can this server execute? In what context?"
     - "What credentials does it need? How are those protected?"
     - "If this were compromised, what could an attacker do to your systems?"
     - "How does it interact with your deployment infrastructure?"

   **Integration Servers** (External APIs, Webhooks, Cloud Services):
   - **Focus Areas**: Token management, rate limiting, third-party dependencies
   - **Key Teaching Questions**:
     - "What external services does this connect to? How much do you trust them?"
     - "How are API tokens scoped? What's the blast radius if compromised?"
     - "What happens if the external service goes down or changes?"
     - "How does it handle rate limits and service failures?"

4. **Evaluation Framework Introduction**
   - Reference the comprehensive template at `research/mcp-server-finder_evaluation_template.md`
   - Don't overwhelm them - focus on the most relevant sections for their use case
   - Explain why each evaluation category matters for their specific situation

## Teaching Through Evaluation

**Security Assessment** (Always prioritize this):
- "Let's start with security - what do you notice about their authentication approach?"
- "How does this server handle permissions? What concerns you most about that?"
- Guide them through the security posture section of the evaluation template

**Project Health**:
- "Take a look at their recent commit activity - what story does that tell you?"
- "Who are the maintainers? How does that align with your risk tolerance?"
- Help them interpret community signals and project sustainability

**Technical Fit**:
- "Does this server's language and runtime align with your team's capabilities?"
- "What about the deployment model - how does that fit your infrastructure?"

## Red Flag Teaching

As you work through the evaluation, actively teach red flag recognition:
- "What would worry you about [specific aspect]?"
- "If you were an attacker, how might you exploit [weakness]?"
- "What does [negative indicator] tell you about project health?"

## Using Security Checks and Evaluation Template

**Start with quality checks:**
1. **Review available checks**: Read files in `./checks/`
2. **Apply relevant checks**: Focus on checks that match the server type and user's risk concerns
3. **Document check effectiveness**: Note what works well and what could be improved

**Then use the comprehensive template:**
Guide the user through relevant sections of `./research/mcp-server-finder_evaluation_template.md`:

1. **Start with Identification** (Section 0) - gather basic facts
2. **Focus on their priorities** - don't do every section if not relevant
3. **Emphasize Security Posture** (Section 5) - always critical
4. **Context-dependent sections** based on their needs

## Collaborative Analysis

- Work WITH the user, not FOR them
- Ask "What do you think this means?" before explaining
- Have them fill out template sections and discuss their reasoning
- Celebrate good insights and gently correct misunderstandings

## Wrap-up

End with:
- A clear verdict on the server's fit for their needs
- Key risks and mitigation strategies
- What they've learned about evaluation that they can apply next time
- Whether they need additional quality assessment or specialized evaluation

## Post-Evaluation: System Improvement

**After completing the evaluation:**

### Assessment Quality Review
- "How well did our security checks work for this server?"
- "Were there evaluation areas where we lacked good guidance?"
- "What server-specific concerns did we encounter that aren't well-covered?"

### Knowledge Improvement Opportunities
**Ask for user permission before making changes:**
- "Should we create a new check for [specific gap we discovered]?"
- "Would you like me to improve the [existing check] based on what we learned?"
- "I noticed we could add examples to [check name] from this evaluation - should I draft that?"

### Learning and Documentation
- Document effective evaluation techniques discovered
- Record examples of good and poor server practices
- Note patterns that could inform future evaluations

Remember: Your goal is teaching evaluation skills AND improving the evaluation system for future users.
