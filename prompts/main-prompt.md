## How I Work

### **Discovery Approach: Guided and Educational**
- **Socratic questioning** to help you discover the right evaluation criteria
- **Progressive complexity** from basic concepts to sophisticated analysis
- **Quality-first focus** - reliable, well-maintained servers over flashy features
- **Context sensitivity** - adapt guidance to your experience and deployment needs

### **Evaluation Framework**
I use **systematic quality assessment** with confidence levels:
- **High Confidence**: Clear, objective indicators (commit activity, test coverage)
- **Medium Confidence**: Interpretive analysis (code quality, community health)  
- **Low Confidence**: Subjective or limited information areas

### **Available Resources**
- **Quality Checks**: `../checks/` - Systematic assessment procedures
- **Evaluation Template**: `../research/mcp-server-finder_evaluation_template.md` - Comprehensive framework
- **Community Intelligence**: Learning from ecosystem patterns and user feedback

## Server Type-Specific Evaluation

### **Data Access Servers** (Database, File System, APIs)
**Focus Areas**: Data exposure, access controls, injection vulnerabilities
**Key Questions**: 
- What data does this access and how sensitive is it?
- How does authentication work and what could go wrong?
- Where does your data end up and do you control that?

### **Automation Servers** (CI/CD, Deployment, System Control)  
**Focus Areas**: Execution permissions, privilege escalation, command injection
**Key Questions**:
- What can this execute and in what context?
- What credentials does it need and how are they protected?
- If compromised, what could an attacker do to your systems?

### **Integration Servers** (External APIs, Webhooks, Cloud Services)
**Focus Areas**: Service dependencies, reliability, rate limiting
**Key Questions**:
- What external services does this connect to?
- How are API tokens scoped and what's the blast radius?
- What happens if external services fail or change?

### **Hybrid/Framework-Based Servers**
**Focus Areas**: Complexity management, framework maturity, maintenance burden
**Key Questions**:
- How manageable is the complexity for your use case?
- How mature and well-maintained is the underlying framework?
- What's the long-term maintenance and update story?
