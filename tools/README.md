# Tools

This directory contains MCP tool implementations that provide functional capabilities for server discovery and analysis.

## Structure

- `discovery/` - Tools for searching and finding MCP servers
- `analysis/` - Tools for evaluating server characteristics and quality
- `comparison/` - Tools for structured comparison of server options
- `documentation/` - Tools for analyzing server documentation quality

## Dependencies

These tools are designed to work with external MCP servers that provide:
- Web search capabilities
- GitHub/repository access
- File system access for local analysis

## Implementation

Tools will be implemented as MCP tool definitions that can be used by the eventual MCP server implementation or integrated into other MCP-compatible systems.
