# MCP Server Finder

**Discovery and evaluation tool for finding reliable, well-maintained MCP servers that fit your specific needs - because with so many servers available, you need the right one for your requirements.**

## Why This Tool Exists

**Anyone can create MCP servers and Desktop Extensions** - no programming experience required. Here's how easy it is:

### Example: Building a Desktop Extension (No Programming Needed)

As Anthropic states in their [official blog post](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/desktop-extensions):

> "Internally at Anthropic, we have found that Claude is great at building extensions with minimal intervention. If you too want to use Claude Code, we recommend that you briefly explain what you want your extension to do and then add the following context to the prompt:"

Simply paste this into Claude or any AI assistant:

```
I want to build this as a Desktop Extension, abbreviated as "DXT". Please follow these steps:

1. **Read the specifications thoroughly:**
   - https://github.com/anthropics/dxt/blob/main/README.md - DXT architecture overview, capabilities, and integration patterns
   - https://github.com/anthropics/dxt/blob/main/MANIFEST.md - Complete extension manifest structure and field definitions
   - https://github.com/anthropics/dxt/tree/main/examples - Reference implementations including a "Hello World" example

2. **Create a proper extension structure:**
   - Generate a valid manifest.json following the MANIFEST.md spec
   - Implement an MCP server using @modelcontextprotocol/sdk with proper tool definitions
   - Include proper error handling and timeout management

3. **Follow best development practices:**
   - Implement proper MCP protocol communication via stdio transport
   - Structure tools with clear schemas, validation, and consistent JSON responses
   - Make use of the fact that this extension will be running locally
   - Add appropriate logging and debugging capabilities
   - Include proper documentation and setup instructions

4. **Test considerations:**
   - Validate that all tool calls return properly structured responses
   - Verify manifest loads correctly and host integration works

Generate complete, production-ready code that can be immediately tested. Focus on defensive programming, clear error messages, and following the exact DXT specifications to ensure compatibility with the ecosystem.
```

**The AI will write the entire extension for you.** No coding knowledge required.

## Project Status: Proof of Concept with Solid Foundation

**Current Status:** This project is in the proof-of-concept phase, but we have high confidence in the approach. The methodology, templates, and assessment frameworks are complete and thoroughly designed. **This is not a question of "can it work?" - it's a matter of building out the practical implementation.**

**What's Proven:** 
- âœ… **Methodology works** - Educational approach and confidence-based assessment framework are solid
- âœ… **Templates are comprehensive** - Quality checks and prompts cover all major evaluation areas
- âœ… **Framework is complete** - Self-improving system design and repository separation are clear

**What's Still Needed:** 
- ðŸš§ **Real server evaluations** - Need to demonstrate the system working on actual MCP servers  
- ðŸš§ **Discovery mechanisms** - Need practical ways to find and index servers systematically
- ðŸš§ **Path portability** - Need to make the system work for users beyond the original development environment

**Why We're Confident:** The core challenge was designing a sound approach to server quality assessment and user education. That foundation is solid. The remaining work is straightforward implementation - applying our proven methodology to real servers and building the tooling to make it accessible.

**Timeline:** Ready to demonstrate methodology and framework now. Practical implementation underway - see [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for specific next steps.

## The Challenge: Finding the Right Server

With the growing MCP ecosystem, there are many servers available for different purposes. **The challenge is finding ones that are:**

- **Well-maintained** - Active development and responsive maintainers
- **Fit for purpose** - Match your specific requirements and use case
- **Reliable** - Work consistently and handle errors gracefully  
- **Quality** - Well-built with good documentation and practices
- **Compatible** - Work with your MCP client and environment

## The Solution: Systematic Discovery and Evaluation

This tool helps you **find and evaluate MCP servers** to choose the right ones for your needs:
- Discover servers that match your requirements
- Assess quality, maintenance status, and reliability
- Compare options systematically
- Learn evaluation skills for ongoing server selection

### What This Tool Does

- **Discover quality servers** - Find MCP servers that are well-maintained and fit your requirements
- **Assess fitness for purpose** - Evaluate if servers match your specific needs and use case
- **Compare options systematically** - Use structured criteria to compare different servers
- **Learn evaluation skills** - Develop expertise in selecting good MCP servers over time

## Who Needs This Tool

**Everyone in the MCP ecosystem:**

- **Users seeking functionality** - Find servers that provide the capabilities you need
- **Organizations evaluating tools** - Assess servers before adoption in business workflows
- **Developers building integrations** - Choose reliable servers for your applications
- **Community contributors** - Discover quality servers to recommend to others

## Expert-Guided Approach

This MCP server is designed as an **expert advisor and tutor** in its domain, with the primary focus on providing guidance, education, and practical recommendations rather than being a comprehensive implementation tool. While it includes enough functional capability to be immediately useful and demonstrate real expertise, the long-term vision is for this server to serve as your domain expert who helps you understand the landscape, evaluate options, and find the right tools for your specific needs. As the MCP ecosystem evolves, this server will learn about new tools and approaches, recommending the best solutions while teaching you how to evaluate and use them effectively. The broader Model Context Protocol Security initiative may also develop comprehensive implementation tools, but these specific repositories are focused on being practical expert guidance systemsâ€”combining deep domain knowledge with enough hands-on capability to provide genuine value, not just theoretical advice.

**AI enables personalized discovery at scale** - the same tool can be a patient guide for newcomers and an efficient expert advisor for professionals, adapting in real-time to what each user needs to find the right server.

### Quality Assessment Approach

Our evaluation approach focuses on **practical server selection criteria**:

**Quality Indicators**: We systematically assess key quality factors:
- **Maintenance patterns** - Active development, responsive maintainers, regular updates
- **Code quality** - Clean code, good practices, comprehensive testing
- **Documentation quality** - Clear setup instructions, usage examples, troubleshooting guides
- **Community health** - User adoption, issue response times, community engagement

**Reliability Assessment**: We evaluate operational reliability:
- **Error handling** - How servers handle failures and edge cases
- **Performance patterns** - Resource usage, response times, scalability considerations
- **Compatibility** - MCP protocol compliance, client compatibility, version support
- **Deployment readiness** - Installation process, configuration options, operational requirements

**The goal**: Create an assessment system that helps users find servers that will work reliably in their specific context and continue to be maintained over time.
