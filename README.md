# MCP Server Finder

**MCP server discovery and recommendation tool. Helps users find existing MCP servers for specific use cases or identifies gaps where new servers are needed. Part of the Model Context Protocol Security initiative.**

## Overview

MCP Server Finder is an intelligent discovery tool that helps users navigate the growing ecosystem of Model Context Protocol servers. Whether you need to integrate with a specific service like Cloudflare or Notion, or accomplish a general task like writing sales emails, this tool will research, analyze, and recommend the best available MCP servers for your needs.

The tool goes beyond simple searchingâ€”it provides comprehensive analysis of each potential solution, including security considerations, maintenance status, and capability assessments, enabling informed decision-making for MCP server adoption. Crucially, it generates structured reports that serve as artifacts for decision justification and future reference, helping users make choices based on their specific needs and constraints.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Discovery**: Uses web search and MCP registry sites to find relevant servers
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Examines documentation, code quality, and maintenance status
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates structured reports for each potential solution
- **Interactive Consultation**: Guides users through decision-making with tailored questions
- **Context Resilience**: Persists progress to filesystem to handle large research sessions
- **Security Focus**: Evaluates servers through a security and safety lens

## Goals and Strategies

### Primary Goals

1. **Reduce MCP Server Discovery Time**: Eliminate the need for users to manually search through multiple registries and repositories
2. **Enable Informed Decision-Making**: Help users understand their needs, constraints, and priorities to make optimal choices
3. **Generate Decision Artifacts**: Create comprehensive reports that justify choices and serve as future reference materials
4. **Provide Comprehensive Analysis**: Deliver detailed evaluation beyond basic functionality matching
5. **Identify Ecosystem Gaps**: Highlight areas where no suitable MCP servers exist, informing development priorities
6. **Enable Resumable Research**: Handle large-scale discovery sessions that may exceed context limits

### Core Strategies

#### 1. Multi-Source Discovery
- **Web Search Integration**: Leverage search engines to find relevant MCP servers across the internet
- **Registry Crawling**: Systematically search known MCP server directories and marketplaces
- **Documentation Analysis**: Read and analyze README files, documentation, and repository metadata
- **Community Resources**: Tap into community-curated lists and awesome repositories

#### 2. Comprehensive Server Analysis
- **Functional Assessment**: Determine what the server actually does vs. what it claims to do
- **Quality Evaluation**: Assess code quality, documentation completeness, and test coverage
- **Maintenance Status**: Evaluate activity levels, recent updates, and community engagement
- **Community Research**: Analyze GitHub issues, discussions, forum posts, and community feedback
- **Security Intelligence**: Review vulnerability reports, security advisories, and audit findings
- **Compatibility Check**: Verify MCP protocol version compatibility and client support

#### 3. Structured Reporting System
- **Requirements Definition**: Create comprehensive report defining user needs, constraints, and priorities
- **Individual Server Reports**: Detailed analysis of each discovered server
- **Comparative Analysis**: Side-by-side comparison of similar servers
- **Gap Analysis**: Identification of unmet requirements and missing capabilities
- **Summary Recommendations**: Ranked suggestions with reasoning and trade-offs
- **Decision Artifacts**: Structured reports suitable for justification and future reference

#### 4. Interactive User Guidance
- **Requirements Clarification**: Ask targeted questions to understand user needs
- **Constraint Discussion**: Explore security, performance, and operational constraints
- **Decision Support**: Guide users through selection criteria and trade-offs
- **Implementation Planning**: Provide next steps for chosen solutions

## High-Level Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering
1. **Initial Query Processing**: Understand user's specific needs or general task
2. **Constraint Documentation**: Capture security, performance, and operational requirements
3. **Goal Definition**: Create structured requirements document saved to filesystem
4. **Scope Planning**: Determine search breadth and depth parameters

### Phase 2: Discovery and Research
1. **Multi-Source Search**: Query web search engines, MCP registries, and community lists
2. **Candidate Identification**: Compile list of potentially relevant MCP servers
3. **Documentation Harvesting**: Retrieve and analyze README files, documentation, and metadata
4. **Repository Analysis**: Examine code structure, commit history, and community activity
5. **Progress Persistence**: Save findings to filesystem to handle context limits

### Phase 3: Analysis and Evaluation
1. **Functional Analysis**: Determine actual capabilities vs. documented features
2. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate code quality, documentation, and testing
3. **Security Evaluation**: Identify potential security concerns and compliance gaps
4. **Maintenance Review**: Assess project health and long-term viability
5. **Individual Reporting**: Generate detailed report for each viable candidate

### Phase 4: Synthesis and Recommendation
1. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare candidates across multiple dimensions
2. **Gap Identification**: Highlight areas where no suitable servers exist
3. **Interactive Consultation**: Engage user to refine requirements and preferences
4. **Recommendation Ranking**: Provide ranked suggestions with detailed reasoning
5. **Implementation Guidance**: Offer next steps and integration considerations

## File System Structure

**TBD** - File organization and structure to be determined based on implementation requirements.

## Context Resilience

When approaching context limits, the tool:
1. Saves all progress to structured files as user accepts requirements or server reports
2. Provides clear instructions for resuming in a new session
3. Maintains state through filesystem persistence with updateable progress tracking
4. Enables incremental research and analysis that can be refined over time
5. Supports iterative improvement of requirements and findings

## Security Considerations

The primary focus of this tool is **finding MCP servers that are fit for purpose** - servers that actually accomplish what the user needs. This is the core concern.

Security evaluation is a secondary consideration during the discovery phase. When security issues are identified, they can be addressed through the complementary tools in this ecosystem:
- **mcpserver-audit**: For comprehensive security analysis and vulnerability assessment
- **mcpserver-builder**: For creating secure alternatives or fixing identified issues

This tool is part of an integrated ecosystem where each component serves a specific purpose, and they work together to provide a complete solution for MCP server adoption and security.

## Usage

This MCP server is designed to be used with MCP-compatible clients like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or other AI assistants. It requires:
- **File System Access**: For persistent reporting and progress tracking
- **Web Search Capabilities**: For comprehensive server discovery
- **Interactive Capabilities**: For user consultation and requirement refinement

## Contributing

This tool is part of the broader Model Context Protocol Security initiative. Contributions are welcome, particularly:
- New discovery sources and search strategies
- Enhanced analysis frameworks
- Security evaluation criteria
- Integration with additional MCP registries
