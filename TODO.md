# MCP Server Finder - TODO and Future Improvements

## Current Status

**Framework Complete** âœ… - We have solid methodology, templates, and quality assessment checks
**Missing Practical Implementation** ðŸš¨ - Need real server examples and working discovery mechanisms

## Immediate Priorities (Make it Demonstrable)

### Real Server Evaluations
**Priority: Critical** - Prove the system works
- [ ] Evaluate 3-5 actual MCP servers using our checks and prompts
- [ ] Document the full discovery â†’ evaluation â†’ selection workflow 
- [ ] Create concrete examples showing good vs. poor quality servers
- [ ] Test prompts with real users to validate educational approach
- [ ] Build `data-db/` with actual server evaluation results

### Working Discovery Mechanism  
**Priority: Critical** - Actually find servers
- [ ] Implement basic GitHub search integration for MCP servers
- [ ] Create search strategies for common server types (data, automation, integration)
- [ ] Build systematic server indexing and cataloging approach
- [ ] Integrate with MCP registry when available
- [ ] Document effective search keywords and discovery patterns

### System Usability
**Priority: High** - Make it work for others  
- [x] Fix hardcoded paths to use relative repository paths
- [ ] Create simple CLI tool or usage scripts
- [ ] Add comprehensive usage examples to README.md
- [ ] Create step-by-step walkthrough documentation
- [ ] Test system on fresh environment to identify setup issues

## Content Development

### Quality Assessment Expansion

- [ ] Build API for programmatic access to assessment data

### Cross-Platform Discovery
**Priority: Low** - Expand beyond GitHub
- [ ] Integrate with npm registry for Node.js MCP servers
- [ ] Add PyPI search for Python MCP servers  
- [ ] Create Docker Hub integration for containerized servers
- [ ] Build package manager integrations (cargo, go modules, etc.)
- [ ] Develop custom registry support for private servers

## Validation and Quality Control

### Assessment Validation
**Priority: High** - Ensure our methods work
- [ ] Create test cases using known good/bad servers
- [ ] Build validation datasets of servers with known quality characteristics
- [ ] Develop metrics for assessment accuracy and usefulness
- [ ] Create feedback loops for improving assessment criteria
- [ ] Implement check effectiveness measurement system

### Template and Framework Refinement
**Priority: Medium** - Continuous improvement
- [ ] Refine check templates based on real-world usage
- [ ] Improve prompt effectiveness through user feedback
- [ ] Enhance confidence frameworks with statistical validation  
- [ ] Create check retirement criteria for outdated assessments
- [ ] Build check versioning and evolution tracking

## Long-term Strategic Goals

### Self-Improving System Maturation
**Priority: Low** - Fulfill original vision
- [ ] Implement automated system improvement based on usage patterns
- [ ] Create machine learning models for quality pattern recognition  
- [ ] Build predictive models for server success and sustainability
- [ ] Develop automated check generation from discovered patterns
- [ ] Create community-driven assessment methodology evolution

### Ecosystem Integration
**Priority: Low** - Become part of MCP toolchain
