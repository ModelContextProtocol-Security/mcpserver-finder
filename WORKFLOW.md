# MCP Server Discovery and Quality Evaluation Workflow

This document describes the strategic workflow for developing and continuously improving MCP server discovery and quality evaluation capabilities through the MCP Server Finder system.

## Core Philosophy: Expert-Driven Continuous Improvement

The MCP Server Finder is designed as a **self-improving discovery and evaluation system** that gets better with each server assessment. Rather than being a static tool, it's a living system where expert knowledge and real-world evaluation results continuously enhance the capabilities for future server discovery.

## The Assessment Improvement Cycle

### 1. Run Security Assessment (Initial State)
- Use existing prompts (`security-assessment.md`, `targeted-evaluation.md`, etc.)
- Apply available security checks from `/checks/` directory
- Document findings, gaps, and assessment quality

### 2. Expert Review and Analysis
- **Security expert reviews assessment results** and process effectiveness
- **Identifies gaps**: What security concerns weren't well-covered?
- **Evaluates check quality**: Which checks were effective? Which produced false positives?
- **Spots patterns**: Are there recurring security issues across multiple servers?
- **Recognizes emerging threats**: New attack vectors or vulnerability patterns

### 3. Knowledge Capture and System Enhancement
Based on expert review, create or improve:

#### New Security Checks
- **CWE-based checks**: Every applicable Common Weakness Enumeration should have a dedicated check
- **AI-specific vulnerabilities**: Prompt injection, model manipulation, training data poisoning
- **MCP-specific attack vectors**: Protocol abuse, client-server communication security
- **Ecosystem threats**: Supply chain attacks, dependency vulnerabilities

#### Check Improvements
- **Enhanced detection methods**: Better automated scripts and manual procedures
- **Reduced false positives**: More accurate identification of real vs. theoretical risks
- **Better examples**: Real-world good and bad patterns from assessments
- **Clearer guidance**: More actionable remediation steps

#### Prompt Refinements
- **Better questioning techniques**: More effective Socratic method approaches
- **Improved educational content**: Enhanced teaching and skill-building elements
- **Context-aware guidance**: Better adaptation to different server types and user skill levels

### 4. Validation and Integration
- **Test new/improved checks** against known good and bad MCP servers
- **Update documentation** with lessons learned and best practices
- **Integrate with security databases** (`audit-db`, `vulnerability-db`, `server-db`)
- **Share knowledge** with the broader security community

## Comprehensive Coverage Goals

### CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) Coverage
**Target**: Every CWE applicable to MCP servers should have a dedicated security check.

**Priority CWEs for MCP Servers**:
- **CWE-79**: Cross-site Scripting - web-based MCP interfaces
- **CWE-89**: SQL Injection - database-accessing servers
- **CWE-94**: Code Injection - dynamic code execution
- **CWE-22**: Path Traversal - file system access
- **CWE-287**: Improper Authentication - authentication mechanisms  
- **CWE-352**: Cross-Site Request Forgery - web interfaces
- **CWE-502**: Unsafe Deserialization - data processing
- **CWE-798**: Hard-coded Credentials - credential management
- **CWE-200**: Information Exposure - data leakage
- **CWE-522**: Insufficiently Protected Credentials - credential storage

### AI-Specific Vulnerabilities
**Target**: Comprehensive coverage of AI/LLM security concerns specific to MCP servers.

**Priority AI Security Areas**:
- **Prompt Injection**: Malicious prompts that manipulate server behavior
- **Model Manipulation**: Attacks targeting the underlying language models
- **Training Data Poisoning**: Compromised training data affecting model behavior
- **Output Manipulation**: Attacks that modify or intercept model responses
- **Context Poisoning**: Malicious context injection affecting decision-making
- **Indirect Prompt Injection**: Attacks via external data sources
- **Model Denial of Service**: Resource exhaustion attacks against AI systems
- **Privacy Attacks**: Extraction of sensitive information from models

### MCP Protocol Security
**Target**: Security issues specific to the Model Context Protocol ecosystem.

**MCP-Specific Security Areas**:
- **Transport Security**: STDIO vs HTTP security implications
- **Authentication Flow**: OAuth 2.1 implementation vulnerabilities
- **Message Validation**: Protocol message tampering and validation
- **Client-Server Trust**: Identity verification and authorization
- **Resource Access Control**: File system, API, and service permissions
- **Protocol Abuse**: Misuse of MCP features for malicious purposes

## Development Phases and Expectations

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Current)
- **High manual effort**: Experts must create many checks from scratch
- **Rapid iteration**: Frequent updates as we discover gaps and patterns
- **Learning focus**: Understanding what works and what doesn't
- **Quality over quantity**: Better to have fewer, high-quality checks

### Phase 2: System Maturation (6-12 months)
- **Reduced manual effort**: Most common security areas covered
- **Refinement focus**: Improving accuracy and reducing false positives
- **Pattern recognition**: Automated detection of common security issues
- **Community contribution**: Multiple experts contributing improvements

### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities (12+ months)
- **Minimal manual effort**: System largely self-improving
- **Proactive detection**: Anticipating new security threats
- **Advanced automation**: AI-assisted check creation and improvement
- **Ecosystem intelligence**: Deep integration with security databases and community knowledge

## Long-Term Commitment to Excellence

### Continuous Improvement Mindset
**We must never "coast" on existing capabilities.** The security landscape evolves constantly, and our assessment capabilities must evolve with it.

### Expected Evolution Areas:
- **New attack vectors**: As MCP adoption grows, new threats will emerge
- **Improved methodologies**: Better ways to detect and prevent security issues
- **Tool integration**: Enhanced automation and workflow efficiency
- **Community knowledge**: Incorporating lessons from the broader security community
- **AI advancement**: Leveraging improving AI capabilities for better assessments

### Success Metrics:
- **Coverage completeness**: Percentage of applicable CWEs with dedicated checks
- **Assessment accuracy**: Reduction in false positive/negative rates
- **User effectiveness**: Improved security assessment skills in users
- **Community adoption**: Widespread use and contribution to the system
- **Threat prevention**: Documented cases of vulnerabilities caught and prevented

## Workflow Integration with MCP Security Ecosystem

### Database Integration
- **`audit-db`**: Store assessment results and findings for trend analysis
- **`vulnerability-db`**: Cross-reference known vulnerabilities with check results
- **`server-db`**: Maintain comprehensive security profiles of assessed servers

### Community Contribution
- **Open source development**: All improvements benefit the entire community
- **Expert collaboration**: Multiple security professionals contributing knowledge
- **Industry engagement**: Integration with broader security initiatives and standards

### Quality Assurance
- **Peer review**: Multiple experts validate new checks and improvements
- **Real-world testing**: Checks validated against actual MCP server deployments
- **Feedback loops**: User experiences drive continuous refinement

## Getting Started with the Workflow

1. **Conduct an assessment** using existing prompts and checks
2. **Document gaps and improvements** discovered during the assessment  
3. **Create or enhance checks** based on findings (with expert oversight)
4. **Test and validate** new capabilities against known servers
5. **Share knowledge** by updating documentation and examples
6. **Repeat** - every assessment should improve the system

This workflow ensures that the MCP Server Finder becomes increasingly effective at identifying and preventing security issues, while building a comprehensive knowledge base that benefits the entire MCP security community.
